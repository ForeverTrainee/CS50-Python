    """
    Point of using yield instead of return:
    if we use return we return every value, 1 sheep, 2 sheep... 100000 sheeps
    this may kill your memory and program will broke
    if use yield loop still works however we will return only final value for example 1 milion sheeps
    so our program will still work/
